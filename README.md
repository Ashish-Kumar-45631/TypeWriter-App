# TypeWriter-App

This project is a collaborative effort that creates a dynamic typewriter effect for displaying names in a user interface. Each character of the name is added to the display sequentially, with a delay of 0.5 seconds between characters, mimicking the experience of typing on a typewriter.

## Features

- **Typewriter Effect**: The name is displayed one character at a time, with a 0.5-second delay between each character, creating a typewriter-like animation.
- **Toggle Display**: A toggle functionality allows users to show or hide the name with a button click, utilizing the `showName` state.
- **Lifecycle Integration**: The logic for incrementally displaying the name is integrated into the appropriate lifecycle method within the `Name` component, ensuring smooth rendering.
